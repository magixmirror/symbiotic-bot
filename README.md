<h1>SymbioticBot - Our Lite Chatbot Using GPT API</h1>
This is a simple and repackaged version of ChatGPT. We plan to integrate it with an image generator and package them together.
Since GitHub pages supports only static pages, it is a large workaround to attempt to make it openly functional here. It is hosted here mainly as a proof of concept, but is functional with a couple of steps.
We will be componetizing this combined simple text and image generator and including it in our main site, and at that point, it will be fully functional.
<h2>How to make it work, if you'd like to</h2>
Download all files in the repository and put them into a folder. You will then need to modify the "mattGPT.js" file in a text editor (Notepad, Word, any IDE) and include an API key at line #2.

If you are a potential employer, please reach out to matthew@symbiotic.love to obtain a test API key, or use OpenAI's website to generate a free one.

If you are an individual, you may obtain a free API key from OpenAI! Simply visit https://platform.openai.com/ and sign up for an account. Once you do, click on your profile in the top right corner and select
"View API keys". Follow the steps to generate and copy one, and then paste it into line #2, between the single quotes --> const apiKey = '';.

  Once you have done this, simply open the index.html file, and everything should work as intended! Free API keys are limited to 3 requests per minute, so if it doesn't work, take a little break and come back in a few.
